## PhoneSensor module

The PhoneSensor module retrieves sensor data from a smartphone, and transforms it into CV signals. It requires the use of the PhyPhox app. Configuration and usage are described in the [documentation](doc/phonesensor.md) page.

## Contributing

Contributions are much welcome! Especially from C++ experienced people, who'll know how to optimize the execution, clean the code, and most importantly, prevent memory leaks. Also from svg-friendly people, to improve the module widgets.

The people who coded VCV Rack and allowed it to be augmented by plugins. And also those who've made the Phyphox app. Also, Dennis Ritchie.
